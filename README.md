# Data Visualisation with R

The world today is filled with data and it becomes imperative that we analyse it properly to gain meaningful insights.  



*Our goal as Data Analysts is to arrange the insights of our data in such a way that everybody who sees them is able to clearly understand their implications, or their truths and how to act on them.
Tableau is the widely used data analytics and visualization tool that many consider indispensable for data-science-related work. Its drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to sort, compare, and analyze data from multiple sources, including Excel, SQL Server, and cloud-based data repositories.*
*### The need to understand plots
There are several reasons why it is important to be able to produce and interpret plots of data.
_Visualize your data_. Plots are essential for visualizing and exploring your data. Plotting a histogram gives a sense of the range, center, and shape of the data. It shows if the data is symmetric, skewed, bimodal, or uniform. Box plots and plots of means, medians, and measures of variation visually indicate the difference in means or medians among groups. Scatter plots show the relationship between two measured variables.
_Communicate your results to others_. Being able to choose and produce appropriate plots is important for summarizing your data for professional or extension presentations and journal articles. Plots can be very effective for summarizing data in a visual manner and can show statistical results with impact.*

_Understand other’s results_. It is essential to understand the plots you find in extension and professional literature.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to analyze and display data using R. We will begin with basic plots and move on to more advanced stuff.


## Pre-requisites
Since this is a tutorial about visualisation in R, basic knowledge and working in R would come in handy.

# <a name="introduction-to-r"></a>1.Introduction to R

## Overview

[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert gentleman at the University of Auckland. It is freely available under GNU General Public License.
R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R is also extremely flexible and easy to use when it comes to creating visualisations. One of its capabilities is to produce good quality plots with minimum codes.

## Installation

We shall briefly go over the steps required to install R ont he system incase you haven't done it till now.

 1.   Go to the [R homepage](https://www.r-project.org/) and select **CRAN**
 **CRAN** is an acronym for -  Comprehensive R Archive Network. It’s the collection of sites which carry R Distributions, collection of R packages and documentation.
 
 2. Select the location which is nearest to you.
 3. Download and Install R depending upon your OS.
 
 *Alternatively, you can use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) over the base R GUI.*
 
 

## R Basics

### Startup
After R is downloaded and installed, simply find and launch R from your Applications folder(MacOS) or from Desktop Icon(Windows).

R is a command line driven program. The user enters commands at the prompt **>** and each command is executed one at a time.

    > 1
    1
    > 'hello World'
    hello world

###  The Workspace

Workspace in R refers to the current working environment . 

# <a name="getting-started"></a>2. Getting Started with Basic Plots

We will be working with a dataset to demonstrate the visualisation capabilities of R. this will help us to know how to create plots on a real data set. For this task we shall be utilising an built-in  dataset  from R.

## Loading the Data
* **Builit-in datasets**

We will be working with the airquality dataset. The dataset pertains to the Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973. This dataset consists of more than 100 observations on 6 variables i.e **Ozone**(mean parts per billion), **Solar.R**(Solar Radiation), **Wind**(Average wind speed), **Temp**(maximum daily temperture in Fahrenheit), **Month** and **Day**.

To load the built in dataset into the R  type the following command in the console:

    > data(airquality)
* **External data**
Data can also be loaded from external data sources like csv,excel, text, html and many more. But to be able to do that , the **working  directory** in R needs to be changed to where you saved the source files. You can easily do that with the **setwd()** command.

`> setwd(path of the folder where the file is located) `
    
Next step is to load the file. In this case it is an csv file named **airquality.csv**. You can download the source from here and place it in the current working directory.

`data = read.csv('airquality.csv',header=TRUE, sep=",")`
The above code reads the file **airquality.csv** into a data frame that it creates called data. **Header=TRUE** specifies that the data includes a header  and **sep=”,”** specifies that the values in data  are separated by commas. 

## Data Exploration
Once the data has been loaded in the workspace, it is time to explore it to get an idea about its structure. Few commands which can be used are:

* **str(data)**
It displays the internal structue of an R object and gives a quick overview about regardign the rows and columns of the dataset.

  ```  > str(data)
    'data.frame':	111 obs. of  6 variables:
     $ Ozone  : int  41 36 12 18 23 19 8 16 11 14 ...
     $ Solar.R: int  190 118 149 313 299 99 19 256 290 274 ...
     $ Wind   : num  7.4 8 12.6 11.5 8.6 13.8 20.1 9.7 9.2 10.9 ...
     $ Temp   : int  67 72 74 62 65 59 61 69 66 68 ...
     $ Month  : int  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
     $ Day    : int  1 2 3 4 7 8 9 12 13 14 ... `

 

* **head(data,n)** and **tail(data,n)**
The head outputs the top **n** elements in the dataset while the tail method outputs the bottom **n**. 
```
> head(data, n=3)
Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3

> tail(data)
   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
109    14     191 14.3   75     9  28
110    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
111    20     223 11.5   68     9  30
```
* **summary(data)**
The summary method displays descriptive statistics for every variable in the dataset, depending upon the  type of the variable. 
```
> summary(data)
    
    Ozone          Solar.R           Wind            Temp           Month            Day       
 Min.   :  1.0   Min.   :  7.0   Min.   : 2.30   Min.   :57.00   Min.   :5.000   Min.   : 1.00  
 1st Qu.: 18.0   1st Qu.:113.5   1st Qu.: 7.40   1st Qu.:71.00   1st Qu.:6.000   1st Qu.: 9.00  
 Median : 31.0   Median :207.0   Median : 9.70   Median :79.00   Median :7.000   Median :16.00  
 Mean   : 42.1   Mean   :184.8   Mean   : 9.94   Mean   :77.79   Mean   :7.216   Mean   :15.95  
 3rd Qu.: 62.0   3rd Qu.:255.5   3rd Qu.:11.50   3rd Qu.:84.50   3rd Qu.:9.000   3rd Qu.:22.50  
 Max.   :168.0   Max.   :334.0   Max.   :20.70   Max.   :97.00   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :31.00 
 ```

We can see at a glance the **mean**, **median**, **max** and the **quartile values** of the variables.

## Basic plotting

R comes equipped with a  `plot()` function that is a kind of generic function for plotting of **R** objects.
*Please note that we use the $ sign to select a particular column in a dataset*

* `> plot(airquality$Ozone)`

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Data-Visualisation-with-R/blob/master/Basic%20Plot.png)

We get a dot plot here wherin each dot represents the value of the **Ozone** in **mean parts per billion**.

* Plotting a graph between the Ozone and Wind values.
` > plot(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Wind)`


![](https://github.com/parulnith/Data-Visualisation-with-R/blob/master/Ozone%20vs%20Wind.png)
The plot shows that wind and Ozone values have a somewhat negative correlation.

* Let us now see what happens when we use plot command the with the entire dataset without selecting any columns.
`>plot(airquality)`
